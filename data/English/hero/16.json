He uses it to guide the souls of those who died in the forest and help them pass on, preventing them from turning evil. He is the most capable among the Tamians in discerning the paths of the stars, pacifying the souls of the dead, and properly guiding them to the afterlife.",

This lamp, powered by a mysterious orb created long ago by a dragon from a distant land, is a treasure of the Tamians. The orb at its core allows nearby souls to materialize, making it possible for its wielder to talk to them directly. As such, it is the ultimate medium for a soul guide. Tamian chieftains have used this relic to carry out the sacred duties of a soul guide for generations. Now, in the face a great danger that threatens the world, the lamp has been passed on to Rephy, the most powerful soul guide in existence."
