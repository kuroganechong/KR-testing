He entered the church with the help of the High Priest Berman, but the religious life was painfully ill-suited for him. One day, however, he suddenly decided to quit his deviant ways, and started following the path of the high priesthood.",

It is said that this divine relic provides infinite holy energy to its owner, along with the power to unlock the true potential of those who have faith."
