She should not have been able to even feel it. But when Malduk took her, she instinctively reached out to the warm presence. Later, when a mysterious magic brought her back to consciousness, the first thing she did was to inspect her coffin, which radiated with tragic yet warm love. Inside, she found the following message carefully engraved: 'My unchanging love for you.'"
