  "story": "As the son of the commander of the Imperial Knights, he has received rigorous training since early childhood to become a proper swordsman. No one can question his title as the fastest swordsman in the imperial palace. The number of enemy knights he felled in the fields of battle is a testament to his skills. He quickly rose to the rank as the vice-captain of the Imperial Guard and is the subject of everyone's admiration. Although he is aware of his beautiful appearance, he detests those who approach him for his outer beauty. He considers inner beauty more important than what is visible. However, he's slightly hypocritical in that he occasionally falls for his own beauty.",

They are capable of gradually enhancing the physical abilities of their wielder, allowing him to break the boundaries of human limitations and gain supernatural power and speed. Because the effect is gradual, there is no sudden stress to the wielder's body. Each piece is called Blood and Rose, respectively. The names originated from the swirl of blood splatter and flower petals that follow whenever Fluss swings these twin swords. No other warrior has been able to utilize their potential as Fluss does."
