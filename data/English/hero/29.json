  "story": "Lulus, very rarely sighted and often considered mythical, are a race of animal hybrids. They live in an extremely cold region, and are very fearful of contacting the outside world. One day, a Lulu child was born with the exact opposite personality that is typical her race. That child is Luna. It's not that she was unhappy with the ways of her people. Nor did she have any grand purpose of experiencing the world outside. She was simply picking flowers, one step at a time. Another step to pick up some frozen branches for her slingshot. And another step to follow the scent of some sweet, red fruit. Before she knew it, she was outside, running toward a carrot field away from the mountain.",

It is said that hyacinths have been blessed by the Queen of Ice, and are able to bear bright red fruits even in the coldest weather. Simply holding onto a hyacinth branch allows one to ignore the coldness around the holder. These blessed trees also have the power to call upon snowstorms and frost. Needless to say, these powers are best harnessed by a weapon carved from one of these trees."
