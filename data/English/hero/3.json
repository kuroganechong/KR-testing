  "story": "Cleo's earliest memory begins at the Tower of Sage. Raised by Dominiks the Great Sage as an orphan, she is both a genius wizard and a troublemaker. Her inability to control her own power has often led to trouble, including partial destruction of the Red Tower, her own residence. Despite this, her apparent immunity to the wrath of the Great Sage has caused her to be ostracized from her peers. Although this has led her to become selfish and inconsiderate, deep inside, she is still a kindhearted girl who fears abandonment by others.",
