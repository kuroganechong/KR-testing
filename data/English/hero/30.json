However, she has been sleeping for ages for some unknown reason. She can command water to turn lands fertile, and she always used her powers to help her people. In return, the humans built the golden Shrine of Flow in her honor under the lake in the oasis. A flow of evil energy in the desert has awakened her from her sleep, and she has once again begun using her powers to help those around her.",

In the ancient days, the nomads of the desert worshipped the blue dragon of the oasis as their protector. In return, she blessed them with rain and gave life to their crops. To show their gratitude, the nomads offered her various treasures, including Lazulia, the gem of water. Although she had no particular interest in material wealth, she accepted their gratitude, and used the treasures to build a temple within the oasis. This ankh is the sacred symbol of the temple, and contains the mighty power of water."
