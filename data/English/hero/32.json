Often considered the Queen of Vampires, she is nigh immortal. The tremendous expenditure of her power during the war against the Demons has taken its toll, and the immortal princess now assumes a child-like form. After the war, she blended into Human society and watched the world change over the next 100 years while slowly restoring her power. When the Demons reappeared and the Holy Sword awoke, Lewisia sensed the sudden shifts of energy. Soon after, she left on a journey to find and observe the newly chosen warrior.",
