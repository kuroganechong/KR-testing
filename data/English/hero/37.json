  "story": "An assassin of the Laughing Mask, and Roi's colleague. Although she has a physical advantage over Roi as a Half-Elf, she lacks his worldly wisdom and his ability to connect with others, traits that made him crucial in large-scale operations. This has given her something of an inferiority complex. As the 'Cleaner' of the organization, she was tasked with eliminating any traitors. When Roi abandoned the organization, she set out to chase him to figure out his motivation, leaving all her other tasks behind. Her plans after finding him remain to be seen.",

Kaitasis, the Demon of the Calm, was especially dangerous among them. Countless wizards and priests were slaughtered by this Demon who specifically targeted magic users for their souls. Eventually, Kaitasis was defeated by Kyle, and its core was sealed away. However, years later, the core came into the possession of the Laughing Mask and it once again served as an instrument of death."
