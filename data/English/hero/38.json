In battle, his Demon blood takes over, turning him arrogant and violent. He inherited this power from his father, whom he never even knew. However, he takes pride in his power and does not try to hide it. Since he is only partly Demon, only a single arm undergoes the transformation. However, even just this single arm contains immense power, and it's certainly not easy for him to fully control it yet. If he loses the control of the arm, the only wise decision is to immediately get as far away from him as possible.",

At other times, he is an immensely powerful and arrogant Demon, just like his father. Barbatos, Jailer of Despair, manifests itself when Ezekiel's Demon blood is in full power. Taking the form of one of his arms, this weapon is powerful enough to slash through dimensions and sever the space itself. It is the physical representation of his father's power."
