During the Duchy's battle against the Demon Army, the Mountain Fortress went on a rampage when its seal was lifted. Under Jane's order, Theo set out to contain it. In his absence, powerful Demon officers attacked the royal palace. Theo returned to fight them despite heavy injury, but was unable to defeat them by himself. When the battle was over, he held the body of the princess in his arms and cried out from the ruins of the palace. Suddenly, a mysterious entity offered him a chance to defend his princess for all eternity. When he accepted, he fell into a deep slumber.",

Forging a spear from lightning was a tremendous task. But then again, Jin was no ordinary blacksmith. He smelted a huge mana stone infused with a red dragon's blood. He used this to contain the lightning before forging it into a spear. Aside from its chosen master, no person can touch this weapon. When its two pieces are combined, it lets out a tremendous flux of energy that resembles a dragon's roar."
