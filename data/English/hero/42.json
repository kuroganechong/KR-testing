  "story": "He was a mechanic of the royal palace of Orvelia in the distant past. However, he was cursed by the mythical creature Redpur and turned into a Redpur himself. Ever since the transformation, he has been living for so long that he forgot his own age. When he was Human, he invented the first portable watch, but no one in Orvelia saw its true value. To give his invention the recognition it deserved, he set out to the empire. On his way, he was cursed by a group of Redpurs who mistook him for a poacher. The curse also affected his watch, giving it a magical power to control the time flow within a living body. Oddy's own time stopped as well.",
