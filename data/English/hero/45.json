Thanks to a unique physical trait, her muscular strength is several times stronger than that of a normal Barbarian warrior. She wields a greatbow larger than her own body with such ease that people call her a walking siege weapon. While she is a kindhearted woman who enjoys helping others, once engaged in a combat, her Barbarian aggressiveness begins to surface. She once slayed a mad dragon named Svelta, a feat that earned her the nickname Dragon Slayer.",
