  "story": "An astrologer traveling with a wandering troupe called 'Stardust.' As a member of the Witch Association, she is supposed to reside in a designated location and read the flow of fate as part of her practice. However, she is currently traveling in search of a man with a particular destiny she met in a dream. She believes that the man from her clairvoyant dream is destined to become the savior of the world. Her current priority is to find the man, and then stay at his side. If asked about her second goal... She blushes and loses all traces of her usual calmness telling about her future with the man of destiny.",
