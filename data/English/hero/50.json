  "story": "A curious merchant who deals every kind of poison known to mankind. She is a daughter of two wandering alchemists who traveled over from a distant nation. Other merchants call her 'the Merchant of Death,' but she has a different opinion. She claims that no poison is inherently evil, and that how one is used determines its nature. Like a true merchant, she believes that any tool is as good or evil as the one who uses it. Since the reappearance of the Demons, she has been traveling around, searching for the right poison to battle against the invaders.",

As the appearance of Demons began to hurt her business, she decided to utilize anything she could, not just poisons. She sought help from her elementalist friend, who imbued the blowgun with the wind's blessing. This gave the weapon firepower equal to that of a magic cannon. After adding Requina's ultra-deadly, Demon-slaying poison to it, it became a powerful and deadly weapon capable of killing any living being."
