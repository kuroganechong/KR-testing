It can transform into three modes, the last of which uses magic that is so devastating that its use has to be restricted. According to Valance, the head of the imperial weapons development organization MagosLe’Flamme, the new weapon Archistra was stolen, immediately after its development, by Crow, a former naval officer who was dishonorably discharged. It remains to be confirmed whether Crow really did manage to infiltrate one of the Empire's most important organizations to steal Archistra... It's also possible that Valance simply handed it over to him, given their long friendship."
