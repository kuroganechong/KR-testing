  "description": "She was a vampire hunter, just as her sister Seria was. However, corrupted by her own power, she slaughtered her comrades and chose to become a vampire herself. After killing and absorbing the powers of the high vampire who turned her, she slipped away from Seria, her older sister and the only survivor, and moved to Orvelia.",
  "story": "Born the second daughter of the ShadowHilt family, Erze also chose to become a vampire hunter after her beloved sister Seria. Erze's feeble frame kept her from learning how to fight with swords, but she managed to become known as a hunter with her talents in magic. One day she fell into a trap during an operation and was bitten by a mysterious vampire on the shoulder. Her weak constitution grew worse, and she suffered from frequent headaches and thirst every night. Erze knew what this meant and what would end up happening to her. She hid the bite and tried to find a cure on her own, distancing herself from her comrades in her efforts. Meanwhile, Seria was dispatched to Windland Snow Mountain to investigate the Vampire Princess that went missing 100 years ago. On the day her sister left... - Ahh, Seria... I cannot control it anymore... Erze quietly and secretly started slitting the throats of her comrades.",
