When Laias fell into a deep sleep after exhausting her powers in the battle 100 years ago, Lilia defended the Shrine of Flow on her own. It was when she heard the children of the desert making desperate prayers that she finally woke up the Priestess of Water to protect them. Unlike her mild and thoughtful sister, she is somewhat strict, and the way she controls the power of flow and water is more aggressive, too. She feels the need to protect her beautiful sister against flirting, unworthy men.",
