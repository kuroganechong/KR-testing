After gaining self-awareness in the creation process, she fled the laboratory and spent the next few years at Ricardo's orphanage. She is capable of casting powerful lightning magic at will. As a combat homunculus, she boasts excellent physical abilities as well. Beneath her appearance as a young girl, she is a confused war machine searching for the meaning of her existence. The wizards of the Tower of Sage bestowed her the title of 'Blue' to indicate her mastery over chant-less spell casting. However, she distrusts wizards and has no desire to associate herself with the Tower.",
