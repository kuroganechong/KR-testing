  "story": "'Listening to the beautiful melody on the battlefield makes me wonder if I am truly in the middle of a battlefield.' 'I dropped the sword from my hand. All the other soldiers present also dropped their swords.' 'It felt as though the girl was in an entirely different plane of existence, removed from the rest of us.' The sensational tale of the pink-haired girl, whose sudden appearance and performance stopped the battle, quickly spread. Her beautiful, captivating melody and her demure, lovely presence has captured everyone's imagination. However, no one really knew where she came from or where she was headed. 'She seemed kind of strange to me, the way she was talking to thin air, as if there was somebody there...' Of course, some have suggested more convincing theories on the girl’s whereabouts, but her mysterious beauty has drowned out all speculation.",

This harp, which insists that it be called 'Mr. Schute,' can significantly amplify the wielder’s mana and spray it all around the wielder. Since the amplified mana is scattered about, it cannot be effectively used as offensive magic. However, depending on how it's used it can prove to be extremely effective in other ways. Mr. Schute is quite a chatterbox, but only to those he considers as his friends. These days he only talks to Shea."
