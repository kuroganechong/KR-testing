The blueprint revealed technology that was far beyond modern engineering, but she managed to interpret some of its content. The result of her study on the blueprint was this lens, which had a similar structure to the eyes of dragonflies. The lens enables the wearer to detect the tiniest of motions and catch sight of the target from hundreds of different angles. She equipped the lens on Kara, the pinnacle of Technomagic, and it resulted in a massive improvement in her attack mode change."
