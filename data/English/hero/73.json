As the first type of the Project Evil Knights that were only made to kill, Chase was brought through a secretive contract with the empire to assassinate the sole successor to its throne, Scarlet. However, he went berserk for unknown reasons during a fight against Clause and Demia who were guarding Scarlet, and he abandoned his mission and left. He failed to kill Scarlet and disappeared, so the nobles who had commissioned the assassination found themselves in trouble. In the end, they hired another assassination group, the Laughing Mask, to have him killed. However, Scarlet already gave him a name, Chase, and let him stay by her side.",

Enhanced Human Type. 0 destroyed everything as soon as he woke up from the laboratory in order to find a weapon that could withstand his power.

This horn went through the hands of the greatest blacksmiths of the empire and became the Blood Lancer Monolith. The flame of sin is burning inside the weapon, and whatever it pierces cannot be healed.
