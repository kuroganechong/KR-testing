  "story": "Chief Guard who manages the Orvel Stockade. In the past, she was once a warrior at the Orvel Arena, and a rival to Gladi. When Gladi began to spend more time running a shop than conquering the Arena, Nicky lost interest too and found another job. Somewhat skilled in training monsters, she applied to be the Stockade's Chief Guard, which is a dangerous yet well-paid job. While the inmates usually refrain from doing anything out of their fear for her, from time to time, they would lose all sense of reason and cause a scene. With each incident like that, her mace drew blood, leaving the inmates to cower in fear again.",

    "story": "The mace wielded by the Chief Guard to keep the inmates under control. It is known as the Mace of Rehabilitation for the unruly monsters in captivity. Although it was passed down from one Stockade Chief Guard in Orvelia to another across generations, soon after Nicky became the new chief, she broke a part of the mace while mercilessly swinging it at the prisoners. -......... She was staring at the broken mace when she turned her eyes to the prisoners. Her eyes stopped at the Hell Beast Hartnon whose entire body was covered with horns. A cruel grin appeared on her face. - You! You've got a pretty eyeball for a piece of trash! In time, the monster's eye went through Blacksmith Jin's hands and became Nicky's new mace. The new mace was perfect for her. The horns sprouting from the mace exuded an excruciating curse, while the deep grudge ingrained in the monster's iris offering ensured a soul-crushing pain. The inmates began to call the new mace 'Hartnon' in remembrance of the beast sacrificed for the weapon. Nicky felt a surge of incomparable pleasure whenever she'd swing the new mace at the prisoners."
